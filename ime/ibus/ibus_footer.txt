END_TABlE

### Since some input methods use different table for every character to make
### phrase, such as ZhengMa, they need explict define the goucima (the
### phrase-building code for the given character), the format of every entry is
### "character\tgoucima\n".
### For the input method which just use the full code as word-building code
### just skip this field. The ibus-table will build the codes needed from
### above TABLE.
### if you don't need different word-building code, please comment out the
### next few lines with ###, just like these lines you are look at now.
###BEGIN_GOUCI
###character_1 goucima_1
###character_1 goucima_2
###END_GOUCI
